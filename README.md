# Essential Blog

Essential Blog is a free content management system (CMS) which contains everything essential to a modern blog. We (aim to) have every functions and codes that are useful and needed by a blog. No themes, templates, plugins, addons are needed!

## Why choose Essential Blog?

There are numerous CMSs like WordPress and Joomla, which are undeniably better than me. So why should you choose Essential Blog?


Nearly all CMSs share a common characteristics. They rely heavily on outside help. For example, WordPress allows users to install themes and plugins to enhance their website's functionality. As an experienced WordPress user, let me tell you: Without themes and plugins, your WordPress site can't even work! You can't activate your site if you don't have an installed theme. And your website will have nearly no attractive functions if you don't install any plugins! This immediately shows WordPress is NOTHING without any outside help! Maybe you will think, what's the problem? What's the problem on relying other people's code?

Most good add-ons and beautiful templates will charge you a huge sum of money, this is not good! For example, many people think they can build an attractive website by using the so-called free WordPress, apart from the little hosting free. This is definitely not true! Have a search on the WordPress themes & plugins directory, most of the add-ons label themselves as "free". But when you come to download them and install it to your WordPress site, you will find out you are using a "Free" version that has minimal function and numerous annoying popup messages will tempt you to buy their unreasonably expensive "Pro" version! 

Apart from that, these add-ons and outside codes may get your website infected with virus. If you accidently download some obsecures plugins, there is a high chance your website will get infected and it is hard to recover from this! This also applies to big-time templates and add-ons, too. It is true that they do not have malware themselves. However, the codes may contain some vulnerability that creates a risk of your site's security! 

Also, they may also slow down your website. Some add-ons developers don't bother to optimize their code (Even I am a little bit lazy about this, LOL!) and some even thinks big codes will impress their clients and can generate more leads. Imagine how long it takes to load this big piece of code! You want to rank higher in SEO? Better page speed? Add-ons and templates are not a good option.
