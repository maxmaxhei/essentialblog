# Essential Blog

Essential Blog is a content management system (CMS) which contains everything essential to a modern blog.

## Why choose Essential Blog?

There are numerous CMSs like WordPress and Joomla, which are undeniably better than me. So why should you choose Essential Blog
Nearly all CMSs share a common characteristics. They rely heavily on outside help. For example, WordPress allows users to install themes and plugins to enhance their website's functionality. As an experienced WordPress user, let me tell you: Without themes and plugins, your WordPress site can't even work! You can't activate your site if you don't have an installed theme. And your website will have nearly no attractive functions if you don't install any plugins! This immediately shows WordPress is NOTHING without any outside help! Maybe you will think, what's the problem? What's the problem on relying other people's code?
